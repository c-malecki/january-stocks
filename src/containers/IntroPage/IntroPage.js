        First created on 7/4/2021 - so it's very unrefined, from the stlye and formatting to my
        written explanations. Will be worked on and updated as I have the time to do so.

        This is an on-going collection of data, simple calculations, and thought experiments related
        to the January "meme" Stocks. I believe there are some interesting discrepencies between and
        possible relationships to be drawn from the data around each of these and their observed
        correlated movements.

          I've watched each of these stocks since January just via charting and daily market
          activities. I've thought a lot about relationships I feel I can observe and conceptualize,
          but haven't made an effort to quantify data and explore these possible relationships until
          recently.

          that was very raw and confusing. Some got the concept, but I mostly failed to lay out the
          ground work in digestible way. It has since been removed by the automod for mentioning
          other stocks.

          to provide a little more context behind my line of thought, although still very abstract
          since it should be more a of preface to the first post with all the raw data.
